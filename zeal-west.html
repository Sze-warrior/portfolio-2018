            <h2>Zeal West Auckland design and build:</h2>
            <p> In late 2017, I participated in the ImpactNPO charity hackathon. The purpose of this event is for NFP organisations to get help on their digital needs from the tech community over a single weekend.</p>

            <p>In the end, I chose to help Zeal West Auckland who came to the hackathon with the need for a new website for their West Auckland branch to raise awareness of the West Auckland branch, help users of the site book music rooms and find out about pricing costs for music rooms and gear hire. Over the weekend my role in our team included the following:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>User-flow mapping</li>
              <li>Web Design</li>
              <li>Front end development in a group of 6 developers</li>
              <li>Brand and visual collaboration with 2 key clients from Zeal West</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Planning together:</h2>

            <p>The main goal of the website for Zeal West Aucklands branch was to allow users of the site to book music rooms and find out costs for venue and equipment hiring.</p>

            <p>The big challenges for our team was learning about the different scenarios a user can go through when filling out a form to book rooms and eqquipment and how to design a pricing calculator that is tailored to the specific costs of the Zeal West Auckland branches prices.</p>

            <p>To help ensure that our time together was well spend, I organised and ran a planning session with the team to help us map out an ideal user flow for the booking form and pricing calculator with input from both technical and visual points of view.</p>

            <p> The end result of the workshop had satisfying results for everyone involved. The team now felt involved and now knew how the site should work and the developers now knew what technical validation was needed at each stage in the journey if there was any needed.</p> 

            <p>Extra key outcomes from our workshop included:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Discussing what extra pages were needed such as an about page, terms and conditions etc</li>
              <li>Outlining what we were missing (e.g. content, social meda links etc)</li>
              <li>What brand guidelines we had</li>
              <li>What tech stack we would be working with</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Design consistency and technical usage:</h2>

            <p>Working in the team we had, we decided that we would use the Bootstrap CSS framework to help us maintain consistency in our CSS and JavaScript code as well as a consistent responsive grid layout. To help us view what we were adding to the project and ensure that no one was repeating work, we utilised the Github software so collaboration was tighter.</p>

            <p>When building the form for booking eqquipment and hiring venues, we utilised Google Forms open source software to allow the admins of the site to be able to keep track of who has hired which rooms and eqquipment for each date and have a record of bookings to help reduce confusion and double bookings.</p>

            <p>When collaborating with the Zeal West Auckland stakeholders, I utilised their existing brand guidelines rather than creating new ones to help keep consistency with their branding, icon designs and typography.</p>

            <img class="img-responsive img-banner" src="img/zeal-west-mobile2.jpg">

            <h2>Result:</h2>

            <p>Although the challenge of leading the whole design process and developing to a new group was daunting at first, the end result was a fantastic learning experience. The website was completed on time for Zeal West with both an online pricing calculator and booking feature for recording room and eqquipment bookings.</p>

            <p>The website is currently being utilised by the team at Zeal West to promote the West Auckland branch and commended by the Zeal West team.</p>

            <blockquote class="quote-description">Michael was responsible for web and UX design but also took the lead in managing the team and monitoring the progress of the project. He did an excellent job in both the website design and as a project manager and in only 2 days him and the team were able to build a user friendly website that is currently used by the charity.
